# TempUN Dataset
We introduce **TempUN**, an extensive and balanced dataset ranging from 10,000 BCE to 2100 CE. The dataset was obtained through web scraping from the following [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) is curated based on global issues and priorities as delineated by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues) and [EU](https://www.undp.org/european-union/our-focus). **TempUN** mitigates the bias towards immutable facts found in TempLAMA; only 16.13\% of its facts remain unaltered, resulting in 83.87\% of the facts being subject to change. **TempUN** encompasses approximately 462,894 records, from which a substantial number of temporal prompts, 9,497,502 (denoted as **Large**), have been derived. However, to accommodate the computational constraints of larger models, we also offer a compressed version of the dataset, which consists of a random selection of 1,907 instances corresponding to 104,130 prompts (referred to as **Small**).
